## Employee Database Management
This project involves three main tasks: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. It focuses on managing an employee database, including creating table schemas, importing data, and performing various queries to extract useful information.

### Data Modeling:
  Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using QuickDBD.

### Data Engineering:
  Create a table schema for each of the CSV files.
  Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  Ensure uniqueness for primary keys; use composite keys if necessary.
  Create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
  Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis:
  List employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  List first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
  List the manager of each department with department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  List department number for each employee along with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  List first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names starting with B.
  List each employee in the Sales department with employee number, last name, and first name.
  List each employee in the Sales and Development departments with employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  List frequency counts of employee last names in descending order.
